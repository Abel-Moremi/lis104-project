		<h3> BACKGROUND/HISTORY</h3>
		<hr/>

		<p> 	
			The history of Batswapong is characterized by migrations of peoples into the country from the north and west and particularly 
			from the east and south, as well as internal movements of groups of people. The group which eventually emerged as most numerous,
			and dominant, were the Batswana. Their pattern of dividing and migrating saw the formation of numerous Tswana tribes, and they 
			eventually occupied the northren area of the country.<br/>

			The term "Batswapong" refers to the ethnic group of people who speak the Setswapong language and share the Sotho-Tswana culture.
			Today, Batswapong, in its contemporary usage, refers to Tswapong citizens of the Republic of Botswana.
			The singular is "Motswapong": a citizen of the country.

		<h3>CULTURE</h3>
		<hr/>
		 
		<p> 
			The Batswapong come from the eastern regions around Selebi Phikwe.
			Tswapong is not all just safaris and more safaris. There is a rich cultural
			heritage that expresses itself in an evolving modern art that is still 
			rooted in deep traditional values.
		<br/>

		<h3>FARMING AND SETTLEMENTS</h3>
		<hr/>
		<p>
			<img src="images/lifestock.jpg"  alt = "PICTURE" style="width:148px; height:148px; padding: 15px; position: left; align:left;">
			Cattle, and to a lesser extent goats and sheep, have always played an important social and economic
			role within Batswapong tribe. Cattle in particular are kept, not only for food and clothing,
			but also as a measure of wealth.
			<br/>
			The larger their herd's size the greater the influence an individual or family has within the community.
			Cattle are also traditionally used as the primary means of exchange. Disputes and punishments handed 
			down by the kgotla were settled with payments of cattle, and men paying their bogadi (bride price)
			would deliver cattle to the woman's family.
			<br/>

		<h3> BELIEFS</h3> 
		<hr/>
		<p>
			Traditional Tswapong belief was centred around the high God (Modimo), who was regarded as the 
			Creator of all things, and the person responsible for all human destiny.<br/> He controlled human
			destiny by sending different weather, in order to indicate through winds, hail, heat, rain 
			(or its absence), and death,his discontent with some departure from tradition and from 
			the proper Tswapong order of things, particularly significant events were acts of God or,
			in the case of death, could also be signs of witchcraft and, therefore, of human envy and greed.
			Modimo however, was distant from people, and the ancestral spirits were usually called on to
			intercede for the Tswapong.
