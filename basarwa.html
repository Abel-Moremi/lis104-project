		 <h3> BACKGROUND/HISTORY</h3>
		 <hr/>
		 <img src="images/san1.jpg" alt = "PICTURE" style="width: 168px; height: 168px; float:right; margin-right: 10%;padding: 15px;">
		<p>
		   The San people (or Saan), also known as Bushmen or Basarwa, are members of various Khoisan indigenous 
		   hunter-gatherer people of Southern Africa, whose territories span Botswana, Namibia, Angola, Zambia, 
		   Zimbabwe, Lesotho and South Africa. The ancestors of the hunter-gatherer San people are considered to 
		   have been the first inhabitants of what is now Botswana and South Africa.<br/> The historical presence 
		   of the San in Botswana is particularly evident in northern Botswana's Tsodilo Hills region. In this area, 
		   stone tools and rock art paintings date back thousands of years. The San were traditionally semi-nomadic,
		   moving seasonally within certain defined areas based on the availability of resources such as water, game
		   animals, and edible plants. As of 2010, the San population in Botswana numbers about 50,000 to 60,000.

		<h3>CULTURE</h3>
		<hr/>
		 
	   <p> The San kinship system reflects their interdependence as traditionally small mobile foraging 
		  bands. San kinship is comparable to Eskimo kinship,    with the same set of terms as in European
		  cultures, but also uses a name rule and an age rule.
		  <br/> 
		  The age rule resolves any confusion arising from kinship terms, as the older of two people always 
		  decides what to call the younger. Relatively few names circulate (approximately 35 names per sex),
		  and each child is named after a  grandparent or another relative.
		  <br/>
		  Children have no social duties besides playing, and leisure is very important to San of all ages.
		  Large amounts of time are spent in conversation, joking, music, and sacred dances. Women have a high
		   status in San society, are greatly respected, and may be leaders of their own family groups.
		  <br/> 
		  They make important family and group decisions and claim ownership of water holes and foraging areas.
		  Women are mainly involved in the gathering of food, but may also take part in hunting.

	   <h3>DRESS CODE</h3>
	   <hr/>
	   <p> <img src="images/san7.jpg" alt = "PICTURE" style="width:148px; height:148px; padding: 15px; position: left;">
		  <br/>
		  <br/>
		  Kalahari Bushmen traditionally will wear very little clothing, although both men and women will wear 
		  some animal hide around the waist and some fur robes over the back. However many have now become me more 
		  western in their dress as increasing numbers become employed in the tourist industry which is developing 
		  in Botswana.
		</p>
		<br/>
		<br/>
		<br/>
		
		<h3>FARMING AND SETTLEMENTS</h3>
		<hr/>
			<p>Villages range in sturdiness from nightly rain shelters in the warm spring (when people move constantly in 
			   search of budding greens), to formalized rings, wherein people congregate in the dry season around permanent 
			   waterholes. 
			   <br/>
			   Early spring is the hardest season: a hot dry period following the cool, dry winter. Most plants 
			   still are dead or dormant, and supplies of autumn nuts are exhausted. Meat is particularly important in the dry 
			   months when wildlife cannot range far from the receding waters.
			  <br/>
			   Women gather fruit, berries, tubers, bush onions, and other plant materials for the band's consumption. Ostrich 
			   eggs are gathered, and the empty shells are used as water containers. Insects provide perhaps 10% of animal proteins
			   consumed, most often during the dry season. Depending on location, the San consume 18 to 104 species, including 
			   grasshoppers, beetles, caterpillars, moths, butterflies, and termites.

	    <h3> BELIEFS</h3> 
		<hr/>
		<p>MYTHICAL FIGURES</p>
	    <ul style = "margin-left: 10%;list-stle-type:none;">
			<li>
				<p>
					Cagn (also known Kaang or /Kaggen) is the supreme god of the San. He is the first being and the 
					creator of the world. Cagn is said to have created the moon which holds special significance to the San
					people; the phase of the moon dictated when rainmaking rituals were to be performed.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
				<p>
				   Heitsi-Eibib is usually as a culture hero. He is sometimes called a trickster. In other contexts,
				   he appears as a patron of hunters and in some stories he even had a part in creating the world, 
				   impressing specific characteristics into different species. For example, he cursed the lion to 
				   walk on ground instead of nesting on a tree.
				   <br/>
				   The multiple roles of Heitsi-eibib have been called a reflection of the fluidity of San religious 
				   resources and rituals, which are usually ambiguous and lack in standardization. Heitsi-eibib was 
				   also a life-death-rebirth figure, dying and resurrecting himself on numerous occasion. Resulting 
				   from this, his funeral cairns can be found in many locations in southern Africa, and it is customary 
				   to throw a stone onto them for good luck. In different accounts, Heitsi-eibib is born from either a 
				   girl or more often a cow, who got pregnant by eating a magical grass. Heitsi-eibib was a legendary 
				   hunter, sorcerer and warrior.
				</p>
			</li>
			<li>
			    <p>
					Tsui'goab is a sky deity associated with the phenomena of thunder and lightning. His name translates
					to "bloodied knee", and he is said to dwell in a red heaven located somewhere in the east, as opposed 
					to Gaunab's black heaven.
			    </p> 
			 </li>
			 <li>
				 <p>
					Gaunab is a god of sickness and death who is locked in constant battle with Tsui'goab.
				</p> 
			 </li>
			 <li> 
				<p> 
				   Utixo or "Tiqua" is the name used by missionaries as a translation for the Abrahamic God
				</p>
			 </li>
			 <li>
				 <p>
				   The Ga-Gorib is a beast who lived on the edge of a pit. It would trick people into throwing 
				   stones at it, but the stones would always bounce back from the creature's hide, and the thrower
				   would fall into the pit.
				 </p>
			 </li>
			 <li>
				  <p>!Xu is considered a benevolent and omnipotent supreme being. He is also the sky god to whom
					 the souls of the dead go. He is said to "Summon the magicians to their profession, and gives them 
					 supernatural powers." The San add that he provides the rain and is invoked in illness, before hunting
					 and before travelling.
				  </p>
			</li>
		</ul> 
					 
		<p>TRANCE<p>
	   <p>
	     To enter the spirit world, trance has to be initiated by a shaman through the hunting of a tutelary spirit 
		  or power animal. The eland often serves as power animal. The fat of the eland is used symbolically in many 
		  rituals including initiations and rites of passage. Other animals such as giraffe, kudu and hartebeest can 
		  also serve this function.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	     One of the most important rituals in the San religion is the great dance, or the trance dance. This dance 
		 typically takes a circular form, with women clapping and singing and men dancing rhythmically. Although there
		 is no evidence that the Kalahari San use hallucinogens regularly, student shaman may use hallucinogens to go 
		 into trance for the first time.
