			<p> The Baherero are an ethnic group inhibiting parts of Southern Africa. Most of them reside in Namibia while others are found in Botswana and Angola</p>
			<p> The Herero originate from the Eastern or Central Africa and migrated across the Okavango river into the Northteastern Namibia in the early 17TH century.</p>
			<p> In the late 19th century, European settlers entered their land and settled there permanently. The German acquired land from the Hereroand established farms there. 
				In 1883 a contract was entered into with the native elders however later the exchange escalated into the basis of German colonial rule. Their territiry became a
				German colony inder the name of <b>German South West Africa.</b>
			</p>
			<p> However, conflict soon arose between the German colonists and the Herero. These conflicts went for long periods, where there was <i>genocide</i> which saw the 
				 remaining people of the tribe flee across the borfer into Botswana

			  <td>CATTLE</td>
			  <td> 
			       <p> Cattle are most valued domestic animals in the Herero culture, therefore cattle herding is the most significant 
					  and substantial activity for the Herero people.
					  <br/> 
					  In the Herero culture the cattle herding and cattle trading activities are only conducted by males while females are
					  responsible for milking cows, carrying out household chores, harvesting small field crops and taking care of the young 
					  children.
					  <br/> 
					  As women are responsible for milking cows,there are also responsible for preparing the delicious sour milk called
					  "Omaere".Although males are responsible for the cattle trading activities the females do most of the trading such as 
					  bartering for other goods. The Herero people take  pride in their cattle, hence the culture of Herero requires women
					  to wear hats shaped of cow horns so as to show importance of cattle in their culture. They also believe that the more 
					  cattle one has, the richer one is, so cattle are a symbol of wealth in this culture.
					  <br/>
					  In celebrations such as marriages, cattle is normally used for meat consumption, whereas for
					  carrying out religious or ancestral ceremonies, ancestors are honored by the sacrifice of cows or other animals.

					      Goats and sheep are also used for meat consumption, and the goat milk is used to make dairy products. The goat skin
						  has a significant use as it can be used to carry babies on the back and create household ornaments.
						  <br/> 
						  In the Herero culture the goat dung is a used for medicinal purposes as it is normally used for healing chicken pox.

				    <td>HORSES AND DONKEYS</td>
					 <td> 
					      <p>
					         Horse and Donkeys are normally used for transportation. In cases of herding or searching for lost domestic animals the 
						     Herero people engage horses to carry out these activities. Herero people consume donkey meat too but rarely consume horse meat.

							to hunt to acquire meat,hides and horns so as to barter for goods such as sugar, tea and tobacco. Chickens are kept for meat 
							consumption and breeding eggs.
